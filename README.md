## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source mobile app

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

This repository is an adaptation of the freecodecamp.org's interactive curriculum to a flutter based mobile application. The mobile app aims to enable a mobile first, offline first user experience for millions of users worldwide who have limited access to internet or a computer.

### Roadmap
The official freeCodeCamp mobile app will feature almost all our services, news, forum, podcast, radio and not to forget learn!

Our mobile developers @Nirajn2311 and @Sembauke will be working hard to accomplish this, but we could use your help in the meantime.
We would love to hear your opinion and great ideas you can come up with!

### Contributing
The freeCodeCamp.org community is possible thanks to thousands of kind volunteers like you. We welcome all contributions to the community and are excited to welcome you aboard.
