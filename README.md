## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source mobile app

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is an online learning platform that offers a comprehensive curriculum in web development and machine learning. The curriculum is self-paced and available free of charge. Our platform offers interactive coding challenges to help learners expand their skills.

To provide more flexibility, we have adapted the curriculum to a flutter based mobile application. The mobile app aims to provide an alternative option for users who are not able to access a computer or high-speed internet connection. This app may be useful for those who prefer to learn on-the-go or need offline access to the curriculum.

### Roadmap
At freeCodeCamp, we're always working to improve our mobile app for our community of learners. Here's a glimpse of what's to come in the future:

- Our developers Nirajn2311 and Sembauke have been hard at work to make sure all of our tutorials, podcasts, Code Radio, and 'Learn' feature are available on the app.
- We are now open to hear your feedback, opinion and great ideas to make the app even more user friendly and tailored to your need.
- In the upcoming updates, we will be focusing on incorporating more interactive features and improving the overall user experience.

We're always looking to make your learning experience even better, and we're excited to hear your thoughts on how we can make the app more valuable to you.
