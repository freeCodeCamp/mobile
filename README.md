## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source mobile app

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

This repository is an adaptation of the freecodecamp.org's interactive curriculum to a flutter based mobile application. The mobile app aims to enable a mobile first, offline first user experience for millions of users worldwide who have limited access to internet or a computer.

### Roadmap
The official freeCodeCamp mobile app will features almost all our services, tutorials, podcast, code radio and not to forget learn!

Our mobile developers @Nirajn2311 and @Sembauke are working on these features, but we can use your help.
We would love to hear your opinion and great ideas!

### Contributing
The freeCodeCamp.org community is possible thanks to thousands of kind volunteers like you. We welcome all contributions to the community and are excited to welcome you aboard.
