## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source mobile app

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

This repository is an adaptation of the freecodecamp.org's interactive curriculum to a flutter based mobile application. The mobile app aims to enable a mobile first, offline first user experience for millions of users worldwide who have limited access to internet or a computer.

### Roadmap

Currently the application is published by @nikunjdk at `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.freecodecamp`. Our goal is to republish this as native application. We invite you to join us in bringing our vision to fruition.
